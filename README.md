# Live Project Summary
## 2-week Live Project for The Tech Academy

During my time with the Tech Academy, I worked on a Live Project for two weeks along with other developers and a project manager. We worked in one-week sprints, with daily Stand-Up meetings, and a weekly Sprint Retrospective. This was a rewarding experience, and I worked on Back-End as well as Front-End User stories. 

### Overall Experience
I gained some valuable skills through this project that would be difficult to replace with study alone. These skills include:
- Using Version Control (Git) on a project with multiple users.
- Using project management software to maintain accountability. In this case, we used Azure DevOps.
- Working with a team who all have their own tasks.
- Learning to effectively communicate about my code.

## Back End

#### Save Button Partial View
The program I was working on had various CRUD buttons all with the same styling, except for the Save button.
